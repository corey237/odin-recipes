      <li>
        Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one
        side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small jar;
        close the lid and shake to mix.
      </li>

      <li>
        Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small, sharp
        knife between the membrane and each rib, and snip off the membrane as
        much as possible.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sprinkle as much of the rub onto both sides of ribs as desired. To
        prevent ribs from becoming too dark and spicy, do not thoroughly rub
        spices into ribs. Store any unused spice mix in a jar for future use.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place aluminum foil on the lower rack to capture drippings and prevent
        flare-ups. Lay ribs on the top rack of the grill (away from the coals,
        if you're using briquettes). Reduce gas heat to low and close the lid;
        cook ribs, undisturbed as possible, until meat pulls away easily from
        the bone, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

        individually on a platter.
